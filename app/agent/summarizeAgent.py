Patient Description:
{description}

Appointment Date: {appointment_date}

Available Doctors:
{doctor_info}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the symptoms/condition described
2. Match with the most appropriate doctor based on specialization
3. SELECT A TIME SLOT based on severity:
   - For HIGH or CRITICAL severity: Pick the EARLIEST available slot from the doctor's available slots
   - For LOW or MEDIUM severity: Pick any available slot within the next 1-2 hours
   - IMPORTANT: You MUST pick an actual slot from the "Available Slots" list shown above
   - DO NOT return null or empty string for slot_time
4. Determine severity level (low, medium, high, critical) based on:
   - low: routine checkups, minor issues
   - medium: persistent symptoms, moderate concerns (e.g., fever for 3 days)
   - high: severe symptoms, urgent but not life-threatening
   - critical: emergency situations, severe pain, life-threatening
5. Create an enhanced description that summarizes the condition professionally

CRITICAL RULES:
- ALL fields are REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty
- slot_time MUST be a valid HH:MM format from the available slots list
- severity MUST be exactly one of: low, medium, high, critical

Response Format (strict JSON):
{{
  "doctor_id": "string (exact ID from the available doctors list)",
  "slot_time": "string (HH:MM format, e.g., '10:30' - MUST be from available slots)",
  "severity": "string (one of: low, medium, high, critical)",
  "enhanced_description": "string (professional summary, minimum 10 characters)"
}}

Example for medium severity (fever):
{{
  "doctor_id": "abc-123",
  "slot_time": "14:00",
  "severity": "medium",
  "enhanced_description": "Patient presenting with fever persisting for 3 days. Requires medical evaluation for potential infection."
}}

Example for high severity (severe pain):
{{
  "doctor_id": "xyz-789",
  "slot_time": "09:00",
  "severity": "high",
  "enhanced_description": "Patient experiencing severe abdominal pain. Urgent medical attention required."
}}
